Fix windows right click to the classic options

Yes, I like the new Windows 11 look and feel of the right-click menu. But when it's missing all of the tools that I need, adjusting the settings to include those tools in the right-click menu is the best option to fix that.

Download the Right Click Classic PS1 PowerShell script. Shift + Right-click on it and choose to run in PowerShell. You will need admin access to edit the registry.

This will also reboot your explorer, so your computer may lock up. Your boot explorer will then reboot. So, be sure to have everything saved before you run this script.
